1. checkPowerAbsorption - Enemy Death Handling: The logic for handling enemy death due to absorption is duplicated both when a new power is acquired and when an existing power is overwritten. This is a redundancy. We can refactor this.

2. While the current texture loading isn't strictly redundant, consider using a TextureLoader once and caching the loaded textures. Three.js's TextureLoader can handle this efficiently. This avoids multiple loads of the same texture data.

3. Consider using texture atlases (spritesheets) to combine multiple textures into a single image. This can significantly reduce the number of draw calls and improve performance, especially as we add more visual elements. 

4. I would like to shift to make the enemies load from a spritesheet and be more like DOOM or HEXEN rather than using cubes (although we might keep the cubes for some other type of enemy or power up idk - they don't look bad, just too basic) 

5. I would like to refactor this so that we load the graphics in base64 from a separate file, rather than including it in the page code as that will make it quite monolithic.

6. The JavaScript code is becoming quite large and monolithic. Consider breaking it down into modules or classes. This will significantly improve maintainability and readability as you add more features.

7. Consider using a more modern JavaScript build process (e.g., Webpack, Parcel, or Rollup) as the project scales. This would allow you to use ES modules, transpile code for better browser compatibility, and optimize the code for production (minification, etc.).

8. Object Pooling: For projectiles and potentially enemies (if you have a lot of them spawning and despawning frequently), implement object pooling. Instead of creating and destroying objects repeatedly, reuse them. This reduces garbage collection overhead and can improve performance.

9. Modularization: As mentioned earlier, break the JavaScript code into modules or classes. For example:

Player class: Manages player state, movement, powers, health, etc.

Enemy class: Manages enemy state, movement, AI, health, etc.

LevelManager class: Handles level generation, clearing, dimension shifting, etc.

UIManager class: Handles all HUD updates, messages, and other UI elements.

PowerManager class: Handles power definitions, firing, absorption, etc.

Game class: The main game loop and overall game state.

10. Collision Detection: The current collision detection is basic (distance checks). For more complex levels and interactions, consider using a more robust collision detection system, potentially a physics engine like Cannon.js or Ammo.js (if you need realistic physics) or a simpler bounding box/sphere collision library.

11. Enemy AI: The current enemy AI is very simple (move towards the player and attack). Expand this with more sophisticated behaviors (pathfinding, different attack patterns, etc.).

12. Level Generation: The current level generation is procedural but simple. Explore more advanced techniques (e.g., using Perlin noise or other algorithms) to create more interesting and varied levels.

13. Debouncing/Throttling: Consider debouncing or throttling certain events, like dimension shifting, to prevent rapid, repeated activations.

14. Web3 Integration
- Develop token system and smart contracts
- Create the power-up NFT framework
- Implement marketplace functionality

### Token System: "The DIP" (Dimensional Integrity Protocol)
- **Utility**: Used to buy special items and combine powers to create enhance absorbed powers, as well as NFTs that confer special benefits/priveliges.
- **Power NFTs**: Rare or unique powers can be converted to NFTs and traded using DIP tokens.
- **Storyline Integration**: The DIP token represents stabilized dimensional energy that helps maintain multiverse integrity.

### Power Collection and Trading
- **Power Library**: Players can build a collection of stabilized powers.
- **Marketplace**: Trade rare or unique powers with other players.
- **Fusion System**: Combine powers to create new variants (requiring DIP tokens).

## Level Design Philosophy
- **Dimensional Puzzles**: Some areas are only accessible with specific absorbed powers.
- **Environment Interaction**: Powers affect the environment differently (e.g., ice powers freeze water for crossing).
- **Hidden Secrets**: Levels contain hidden areas with rare powers or DIP token caches.
- **Warden's Domain**: Special challenge areas where The Warden directly confronts the player.



Refactoring checkPowerAbsorption (Addressing Redundancy)

Here's a refactored version of checkPowerAbsorption to eliminate the duplicated enemy death handling:

function checkPowerAbsorption() {
    const raycaster = new THREE.Raycaster();
    const direction = new THREE.Vector3(0, 0, -1).applyQuaternion(camera.quaternion);
    raycaster.set(camera.position, direction);
    const intersects = raycaster.intersectObjects(gameState.enemies);

    if (intersects.length > 0 && intersects[0].distance < 5) {
        const enemy = intersects[0].object;
        const enemyPower = enemy.userData.power;
        const hasPower = gameState.powers.includes(enemyPower);
        let powerSlot = -1;

        if (!hasPower) {
            powerSlot = gameState.powers.findIndex(slot => slot === null);
            if (powerSlot === -1) {
                showWardenMessage("All power slots are full. Swap powers by absorbing while selecting a slot.");
                return;
            }
        } else {
            powerSlot = gameState.currentPower;
            if (gameState.powers[powerSlot] === enemyPower) {
                showWardenMessage(`Already using ${powerTypes[enemyPower].name}`);
                return;
            }
        }

        // Apply power and absorption effect (common logic)
        gameState.powers[powerSlot] = enemyPower;
        updatePowerSlots();
        const powerName = powerTypes[enemyPower].name;
        const message = hasPower
            ? `Replaced power slot ${powerSlot + 1} with ${powerName}`
            : `Absorbed ${powerName} from ${enemy.userData.type}`;
        showWardenMessage(message);
        createAbsorptionEffect(enemy.position, powerTypes[enemyPower].color);

        // Damage enemy and handle death (extracted to a separate function)
        damageEnemy(enemy, 20);
    } else {
        showWardenMessage("No power source detected in range");
    }
}

function damageEnemy(enemy, damage) {
    enemy.userData.health -= damage;
    updateHealthBar(enemy);

    if (enemy.userData.health <= 0) {
        gameState.enemiesDefeated++;
        gameState.totalEnemiesDefeated++;
        updateKillCounter();

        if (gameState.enemiesDefeated >= gameState.levelEnemyCount) {
            nextLevel();
        }

        createHealthPickup(enemy.position.clone());
        scene.remove(enemy);
        gameState.enemies.splice(gameState.enemies.indexOf(enemy), 1);

        setTimeout(() => {
            if (gameState.enemies.length < 15 && gameState.enemiesDefeated < gameState.levelEnemyCount) {
                spawnEnemies(1);
            }
        }, 5000);
    }
}
